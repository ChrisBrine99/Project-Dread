/// @description A simple function that updates the dimensions of the current window to match the current
/// camera dimensions with a given scale applied to the values (Shown as "_width" and "_height" in the
/// argument fields. It also keeps the window centered on the display it's being rendered on.
/// @param width
/// @param height
function window_update_dimensions(_width, _height){
	// First, determine the maximum possible scaling that the window can achieve before either the width OR
	// the height surpasses the resolution of the current display. That value will then be used to clamp the
	// provided dimensions to a valid range.
	var _maxScale = min(floor(display_get_width() / CAM_WIDTH), floor(display_get_height() / CAM_HEIGHT));
	_width = clamp(_width, CAM_WIDTH, CAM_WIDTH * _maxScale);

	// Then, the offset of the window based on its width and height from the center of the display is calculated
	// in order to keep the window centered on said display. Otherwise, updating the dimensions will cause it
	// to expand to the right and downward.
	var _xOffset, _yOffset;
	_xOffset = floor((display_get_width() - _width) / 2);
	_yOffset = floor((display_get_height() - _height) / 2);
	
	// Finally, set the size of the window to the final width and height values and the position to the offset
	// so it remains in the center of the screen.
	window_set_size(_width, _height);
	window_set_position(_xOffset, _yOffset);
