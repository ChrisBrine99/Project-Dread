# What Lies Below (Codename: Project Dread)

The goal with this project is to create a new kind of survival horror game; one that takes elements from both the Silent Hill and Resident Hill series of games to create an experience that has never been seen before in the genre. 

You'll play as Claire Warren, a college student down on her luck; having to balance school and a job--all the while taking care of her little brother, Jacob. However, one night she returns home incredibiliy late to find that her brother is nowhere to be found. With no signs of forced entry into the apartment, it's up to her to figure out where Jacob went, who/what took him, and why strange things have been happening to her on top of everything else.

Some core features of the game include:
- Heavy emphasis on resource management; similar to how the original Resident Evil trilogy on the PSX functioned with their limited inventory space, ammunition, weapons, and game saves themselves.
- Multiple combat difficulty modes (Three available by default; two unlockable) that are all tailored to give a unique experience to the player while also maintaining the overall tension, atmosphere, and horror of the game itself.
- Three choices for puzzle difficulty that will add/remove certain elements of puzzles in order to make them easier or harder for the player to solve. This feature was inspired by the "Riddle Difficulty" system from the PlayStation 2 Silent Hill games.
- A world designed much like how a mertroidvania-style game would build its world: many branching paths, areas blocked off by key items that must be found through exploring, environmental and general puzzles to solve, backtracking to older areas to open new areas to explore, and so on.
- A story that attempts to unearth the trauma Claire has experienced in her life; the demons she's kept locked away for years. Will she be able to overcome the past and make it out a better person? Or will she keep ignoring it and let the issues completely consume her? The choice is yours...
